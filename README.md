## Iris Flower Classificator with Scikit Learn, Numpy, Pandas, Streamlit and Deployed with Flask 

The Model was trained with Tabular Breast Cancer Data and with the `Logistic Regression` Scikit-Learn Architecture. The Model predicts if a given cell is either `Benign` or `Malignant`, also the U.I. to select the parameters of the cell was built with Streamlit and the API with Flask. Last, the Flask API was deployed on AWS EC2.
